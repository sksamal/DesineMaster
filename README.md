DeSiNe
======

DeSiNe is a modular flow-level network simulator aimed at performance analysis and benchmarking of Quality of Service routing algorithms and traffic engineering extensions.

We are a group of researchers at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, working in analysis,evaluation and designing of topologies using optical communications in Data Center Networking(DCN). DeSine seemed to be the right fit for us to test our research. We adapted the the code from https://github.com/TUDelftNAS/DeSiNe to suit our needs.

The original authors describe their design in the following paper: 

T. Kleiberg, B. Fu, F.A. Kuipers, S. Avallone, B. Quoitin, and P. Van Mieghem, DeSiNe: a flow-level QoS simulator of Networks, Proc. of the first International Workshop on the Evaluation of Quality of Service through Simulation in the Future Internet (QoSim), Marseille, France, March 3, 2008.
