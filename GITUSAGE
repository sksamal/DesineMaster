========
OVERVIEW
========
This is a git repository hosted at git.unl.edu. If you are new to version control, 
we recommend you to look at some of the git basics. The tutorial 
at https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/ might be helpful. 

This repository is private and can be cloned by only the members belonging to the 
project. If you are not a member yet, contact one of the team members to add you 
to the project.It also requires that you have an UNL account which will be needed 
for authentication to access the project.

Changes to the repository can be pushed by only the members that have write access. 
This will need that your SSH Keys are uploaded for access. Here are steps:
(1) Based on your OS, generate a SSH RSA/DSA Key Pair. I suggest to follow steps 
 at this link:
    https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/
(2) Logon to git.unl.edu with UNL account access. Go to "Profile Settings"-->
  "SSH Keys" -->Click on the "Add SSH Key" button.
(3) Open your public key (which normally has the extension of ".pub") in a text 
  editor, copy all its contents and paste it in the "Key" section. Click on the 
  "Add Key" button to successfully add the public key to your account.
(4) You should have permissions to push changes to the repository now.

Note, currently there are no separate branches (as the team size is small). Hence, 
we need to make sure that we are reviewing and pushing in the correct changes 
properly. A good idea is to notify other developers when you pushed a set 
of changes.
